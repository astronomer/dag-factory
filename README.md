Welcome to *dag-factory*! *dag-factory* is a library for [Apache AirflowÂ®](https://airflow.apache.org) to construct DAGs
declaratively via configuration files.

The minimum requirements for **dag-factory** are:

- Python 3.9.0+
- [Apache AirflowÂ®](https://airflow.apache.org) 2.4+

For a gentle introduction, please take a look at our [Quickstart Guide](https://astronomer.github.io/dag-factory/latest/getting-started/quick-start-airflow-standalone/). For more examples, please see the
[examples](/examples) folder.
