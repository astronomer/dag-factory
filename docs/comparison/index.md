# Using YAML instead of Python

By default, Apache AirflowÂ® users write their workflows, or sequences of tasks, in Python.

DAG Factory offers an alternative interface, allowing users to represent Airflow workflows via YAML files, often using less code.

This section illustrates a few examples of how to represent the same workflow using plain Airflow Python DAGs in comparison
to their representation using DAG Factory YAML files.
