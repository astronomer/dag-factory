This document describes how to contribute to DAG Factory, covering:

- How to set up the local development environment
- Running tests
- Pre-commit and linting
- Authoring the documentation
- Releasing

## Overview of how to contribute

To contribute to the DAG Factory project:

1. Please create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/issues) describing a bug, enhancement, or feature request.
2. Open a branch off of the `main` branch and create a Pull Request into the `main` branch from your feature branch.
3. Link your issue to the pull request.
4. After you complete development on your feature branch, request a review. A maintainer will merge your PR after all reviewers approve it.

## Set up a local development environment

### Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) <= 3.12 (due to dependencies, such as ``google-re2`` not supporting Python 3.13 yet)
- [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/)

Clone the **DAG Factory** repository and change the current working directory to the repo's root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory.git
cd dag-factory/
```

After cloning the project, there are two options for setting up the local development environment:

- Use a Python virtual environment, or
- Use Docker

### Using a Python virtual environment for local development

1. Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    make setup
    ```

2. Activate the local python environment:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Set [Apache AirflowÂ®](https://airflow.apache.org/) home to the ``dev/``, so you can see DAG Factory example DAGs.
Disable loading Airflow standard example DAGs:

```bash
export AIRFLOW_HOME=$(pwd)/dev/
export AIRFLOW__CORE__LOAD_EXAMPLES=false
```

Then, run Airflow in standalone mode; the command below will create a new user (if it does not exist) and run the necessary Airflow component (webserver, scheduler and triggered):

> Note: By default, Airflow will use sqlite as a database; you can override this by setting the variable ``AIRFLOW__DATABASE__SQL_ALCHEMY_CONN`` to the SQL connection string.

```bash
airflow standalone
```

After Airflow is running, you can access the Airflow UI at ``http://localhost:8080``.

> Note: whenever you want to start the development server, you need to activate the ``virtualenv`` and set the ``environment variables``

### Use Docker for local development

It is also possible to build the development environment using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/):

```bash
make docker-run
```

After the sandbox is running, you can access the Airflow UI at ``http://localhost:8080``.

This approach builds a DAG Factory wheel, so if there are code changes, you must stop and restart the containers:

```bash
make docker-stop
```

## Testing application with hatch

The tests are developed using PyTest and run using hatch.

The [pyproject. toml](https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/blob/main/pyproject.toml) file currently defines a matrix of supported versions of Python and Airflow against which a user can run the tests.

### Run unit tests

To run unit tests using Python 3.10 and Airflow 2.5, use the following:

```bash
hatch run tests.py3.10-2.5:test-cov
```

It is also possible to run the tests using all the matrix combinations, by using:

```bash
hatch run tests:test-cov
```

### Run integration tests

> Note: these tests create local Python virtual environments in a hatch-managed directory.
> They also use the user-defined `AIRFLOW_HOME`, overriding any pre-existing `airflow.cfg` and `airflow.db` files.

First, set the following environment variables:

```bash
export AIRFLOW_HOME=$(pwd)/dev/
export CONFIG_ROOT_DIR=`pwd`"/dev/dags"
export PYTHONPATH=dev/dags:$PYTHONPATH
```

To run the integration tests using Python 3.9 and Airflow 2.9, use

```bash
hatch run tests.py3.9-2.9:test-integration-setup
hatch run tests.py3.9-2.9:test-integration
```

## Pre-Commit and linting

We use pre-commit to run several checks on the code before committing. To install pre-commit hooks, run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

To run the checks manually, run the following:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Pre-commit runs several static checks, including Black and Ruff. It is also possible to run them using ``hatch``:

```bash
hatch run tests.py3.9-2.9:static-check
```

## Write docs

We use Markdown to author DAG Factory documentation.

Similar to running tests, we also use hatch to manage the documentation.

To build and serve the documentation locally:

```bash
hatch run docs:dev
```

To release the documentation with the current project version and set it to the latest:

```bash
hatch run docs:gh-release
```

## Releasing

We currently use [hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) for building and distributing ``dag-factory``.

We use GitHub actions to create and deploy new releases. To create a new release, update the latest release version.

It is possible to update the version either by using hatch:

> Note: You can update the version in several different ways. To learn more, check out the [hatch docs](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/version/#updating).

```bash
hatch version minor
```

Or by manually updating the value of `__version__` in `dagfactory/__init__.py`.

Make sure the [CHANGELOG file](https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) is up-to-date.

Create a release using the [GitHub UI](https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/releases/new). GitHub will update the package directly to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dag-factory/).

If you're a [project maintainer in PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dag-factory/), it is also possible to create a release manually,
by authenticating to PyPI and running the commands:

```bash
hatch build
hatch publish
```
